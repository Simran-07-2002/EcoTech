## Features

- Measure Air Quality Index
- Measure Water Quality Index
- Measure Deforestation Quality Index
- Measure Climatic Index


## Getting Started
## Usage/Examples

Welcome to "Enviroverse", your hub for monitoring and analyzing environmental indices. Here's how you can make the most of our platform:

Explore Environmental Data

- Air Quality: Start by selecting your location on the map or entering a city name. Our platform will provide historical Air Quality Index (AQI) data, pollutant concentrations for your area using a dashboard.

- Water Quality: Navigate to the "Water Quality" under Features and specify your city/country name. Discover insights into water pollution levels and trends, along with visualizations to aid your understanding using a dashboard.

- Deforestation Rates: Choose a forested region. Our platform will offer historical data on deforestation rates, illustrated through dashboard.

- Climate Patterns: Access the climate patterns under Features section and select a specific region or country. Explore historical climate data, including temperature variations through dashboard.

 




## Code Details

Utilized Technologies

An outline of the technologies employed is provided below:

Flask backend development
- Framework for Flask: Flask, a compact and adaptable Python web framework, powers the platform's backend. Flask makes it possible to construct APIs, process data, and handle requests effectively.

- Python: It is the primary programming language utilized to create the backend logic. Python is perfect for handling and analyzing data because of its simplicity and large library of resources.

 UI/UX Development:

- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap: The HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap framework were used to develop the user interface. The platform is accessible on a variety of devices thanks to this combination, which guarantees a responsive and aesthetically pleasing design.

**JavaScript:** On the website, JavaScript is utilized for interactive features like real-time data retrieval and display, user experience improvement, and dynamic content changes.

##Data visualization:

Tableau Dashboard: Tableau is used to create engaging and educational dashboards that offer users intelligent visualizations of environmental data. These dashboards improve comprehension of intricate data patterns.


##Deployment :

Hosting Platform: Our "Enviroverse" project is hosted on the Github platform.

### APIs: 
- API Integrations: To link external APIs with the dashboard and deliver real-time insights for environmental indices, we need to have a Tableau subscription or you can access it using your work/school mail to get free license.

### Version Control:
Version control is handled through GitHub and Git. Describe the process used to maintain version control, whether it uses Git, GitHub, or another system. Include a URL to the GitHub repository for your project.



## Data Sources


In order to deliver precise and current environmental information, "Enviroverse" draws on a variety of datasets from reliable sources. We appreciate the following data providers for providing information for our platform:

Data on Air Quality:

- Kaggle Dataset for Air Quality: We make use of air quality datasets from Kaggle, a well-known data science platform. These databases offer historical and real-time measurements of the air quality, such as the Air Quality Index (AQI), pollutant concentrations, and health warnings. The information is gathered from numerous monitoring stations across the world, assuring complete coverage.

Data on Water Quality:

- Kaggle Dataset on Water Quality: Our knowledge of water quality is based on Kaggle datasets. These datasets cover many different aspects of water quality, such as pH values, dissolved oxygen concentrations, turbidity, and contaminant concentrations. They are the result of significant global water quality monitoring activities.

Data on Deforestation:

- Kaggle Dataset on Deforestation: We rely on Kaggle datasets to monitor deforestation rates. These databases offer historical information on changes in land use, deforestation, and forest cover. They are crucial in assisting us in visualizing and examining trends in deforestation.
